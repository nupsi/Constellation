# What is it?
Constellation is a visual scripting language for unity that gives you the tools of a programmer without having to write a single line of code. It's currently in alpha, which means there are a lot of incomplete features/bugs. If you find one, feel free to report it [here](https://www.constellationeditor.com/forum-1/suggestions)

# Who should use it?
Designers, Artists, programmers... Constellation is easy to use and extendable if you want to use your [custom scripts](https://github.com/ConstellationLanguage/Constellation/wiki/Create-a-node).

# Why using visual scripting?
Go check [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/7nzkdx/constellation_open_source_visual_scripting_editor/) on reddit. I think it gives you downsizes and advantages of it.
